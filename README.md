## Homework 1
HW1 is the Homework 1 folder

Exercise 1 is placed in EX1.png.

Exercise 2 is solved in two pages EX2-1.png and EX2-2.png

The Mishra’s Bird function is implemented in f.m file for exercises 3 and 4. The constraint is added by adding the inverse of the heaviside function to the Mishra’s Bird function.

Nelder-Mead method is implemented in NMM.mlx MALAB script file. 

Plots of triangles for the first task of Exercise 3 are placed in Triangles_1_exp and Triangles_2_exp. The Nelder-Mead script can save the behavior of triangles in the Triangles folder.
It contents plots of one more additional experiment. Plots are named as i.png where i is the number of ineration. 
Plots in Triangles_1_exp and Triangles_2_exp show the behaviour of the method for the two different initial simplexes from the task 2.

Explicit report on the results of the method for these two points is written in Ex_3.xlsx, table "2.".

Variation of parameters alpha, beta and gamma for the second point is reported in Ex_3.xlsx, table "3.".

Coordinate descend method for the Mishra’s Bird function with the constrained is implemented in CD.mlx. 
Vertices and the center of the trianle from the 3 task of the Exercise 2 was used for its comparison with Nelder Mead algorithm. The results are reported in Ex_4.xlsx
